    /*
     Toggle ShopView Visibility: Under the ContentView, implement a button that toggles the visibility of the ShopView.
     Close ShopView on Content View Tap: Implement a functionality where clicking anywhere on the content view toggles off the ShopView.
     Update Clicks Multiplier: When the button in the ShopView is used, add the multiplier to the number displayed under "Clicks Multiplier" in the ContentView. Convert the multiplier from a string to an integer if necessary.
     Update ContentView Tap Action: Change the action performed by the tap gesture in the ContentView to increment by a variable instead of a constant value. This variable should be updated when someone buys from the shop, and its value should be determined by the multiplier specified in the ShopView.
